            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <h3>Ground</h3>
            <p>
                The ground is made up of rectangular huts, it is entirely bordered by
                walls. The surface of the ground is not known by the BOT! A BOT occupies
                one square. One unit of energy occupies one square.
            </p>
            <h3>Simulation</h3>
            <p>
                A game round consists of a communication sequence between the simulator
                and a bot. Simulator: executes the energy consumption for a BOT BOT:
                determines the terrain scan level from 0 to 255 Simulator: scanning
                takes place BOT : Determines an action (none, move, shoot, shield, hide,
                ...)
            </p>
            <h3>Bot caracteristics</h3>
            <p>
                A BOT has only one life. He loses his life if his energy level drops to
                zero. It is simply disconnected from the server. Each BOT starts with
                100 units of energy. A BOT has lost if its energy reserve falls to zero.
                There is no limit to energy storage There is a loss of at least 1 unit
                of energy for each turn, even without any detection or action taken.
            </p>
            <h3>Item caracteristics</h3>
            <h4>Energy capsules</h4>
            <p>
                On the playground, it is possible to find energy capsules. Simply pass
                over an energy capsule to retrieve its contents. Energy capsules will
                appear randomly on the field.
            </p>
            <h4>Protection</h4>
            <p>
                It is possible to activate a protective shield. It will be assigned a
                certain power level, which will be deducted in energy units for
                activation. At each turn it will consume 1 unit of energy to maintain
                its power level. If you take 1 hit, it loses 1 unit of power. If its
                power drops to zero, it is then inactive.
            </p>
            <h4>Cloaks</h4>
            <p>
                It's possible to make yourself invisible by activating an occulting
                field. It will be assigned a certain level of power which will be
                deducted in units of energy for activation. This power level is the
                distance at which the occulting field is active.
            </p>
            <h3>Move rules</h3>
            <p>
                It is possible to move one box in the 4 directions : north, south, east
                and west. The box must be empty or contain an energy capsule. If the box
                contains an energy capsule: the energy contained in this capsule is then
                absorbed. If the box is occupied by a block: loss of 1 in energy If the
                box is occupied by another Bot, each Bot loses one in energy.

            <h3 class="deathmatch">Deathmatch</h3>
            <p>
                <!--<img/>map Deathmatch-->
                12 players divided into 2 teams of six fight on a perfectly symmetrical battlefield.
                As you can see, strategy will be the key word in this mode of play, where each placement
                will be decisive in order to gain the upper hand over the opponent.
            </p>
            <h3 class="energychase">Energy Chase</h3>
            <p>
                <!--<img/> map energyChase-->
                Energy chase is playable from 2 to 8 players maximum. The goal is simple, the player who collects the most energy wins the game.
                Beware of traps that will make you reappear on the appearance square. And to the limited number of energy recoverable on the field. Avoid slipping!
